**Intro**
  
Spots is a website designed to showcase art gallery pieces. Spots uses dynamic responsiveness to allow the art pieces to be visible smoothly across desktop and mobile devices.

**Technologies / Techniques**

* Using a combination of Flexbox and Grid, I was able to style the Profile Section and Card Section as seen below. 
* Media Queries were used to allow smooth experiences on both desktop and mobile devices.
* This project also follows BEM methodology to structure my files and CSS code neatly. 
* Google Fonts were imported into this project, specifically Poppins font face.
* Figma was used as the blueprint for designing this website. See the link to the figma project below!
